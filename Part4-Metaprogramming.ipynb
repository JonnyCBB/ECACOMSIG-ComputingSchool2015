    "###A more useful example\n",
    "Here is an example from a (very useful) Julia Package called **Devectorize.jl**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many programming languages (including Julia), expressions are immediately evaluated upon construction. This simple strategy often results in less than optimal behaviors, which, for example, include *creation of unnecessary temporaries* and *repeated memory round-trips*. Consider the following example,\n",
    "\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "r = a .* b + c .* d + a\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With immediate evaluation, three temporaries, respectively for storing the results of ``a .* b``, ``c .* d ``, and ``a .* b + c .* d``. Also, the array ``a`` will be traversed twice. Moreover, computation on large arrays is often memory-bound -- the run-time performance largely depends on how many times you have to scan the arrays. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the formula above, a much more efficient way to evaluate it can be expressed using for-loops as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "n = length(a)\n",
    "r = zeros(n)\n",
    "for i = 1 : n\n",
    "\tr[i] = a[i] * b[i] + c[i] * d[i] + a[i]\n",
    "end\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With this piece of code, you can get all the results in one pass, without creating any temporary arrays.\n",
    "However, low-level for-loops are often much longer and more difficult to read, write, and maintain. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Is it possible to combine the elegance of high-level expressions and the performance of low-level for-loops?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes it is!\n",
    "\n",
    "We can write something like \n",
    "```julia\n",
    "@devec r = a .* b + c .* d + a\n",
    "``` \n",
    "To obtain the required performance benefits\n",
