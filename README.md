# ECACOMSIG-ComputingSchool2015
A repository to store presentation and tutorial materials for the crystallography computing school in Rovinj, Croatia, August 2015

The presentation slides can be viewed [here](http://prezi.com/iwuq_srt96_a/?utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=copy)

Otherwise you can view and run the IPython notebooks which contain the material that was demo'd at the computing school.   

The Tutorial.md file contains exactly what it says on the tin (or more appropriately, in the filename). This is the file that contains the actual tutorial material for the practical. 
Or you can use Tutorial.pdf if you prefer pdfs.
