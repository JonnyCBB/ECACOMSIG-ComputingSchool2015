    "#Introduction to (why I love) Julia: Part 2 - Types and Multiple Dispatch\n",
    "Now I'm far from a programming guru and to be honest I had no idea what multiple dispatch meant the first time someone told me that this was an awesome feature of Julia. But it turns out it actually is awesome. I also have a much greater appreciation for the significance of types too. As someone who came into programming from a mathematical standpoint (I just wanted the programs to execute the maths I wrote down on paper without care for what the computer was doing behind the scenes), types didn't strike me as something I should worry about. But Julia is so nice that it makes you want to know.   \n",

    "#####The Problem\n",
    "All seems ok at first glance, especially if you're used to programming in other scripting languages. But take a look at the number of bytes allocated and the garbage collection (gc) time. Around half of the time is spent not actually performing the computation. Something isn't right here.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is with `s`. As mentioned previously, Julia infers the types of the variables, therefore it is important to take note of the types of the variables throughout the function (well it's important if you want good performance from your code). In this example `s` is initially inferred as an integer but when we enter the loop and divide the first value of `i`, namely 1, by two and assign it to `s`, `s` becomes equal to 0.5 which is not an integer.   \n",
    "This is called **type instability**. Type instabilities prevent the compiler from generating efficient machine code and hence result in sub-optimal performance.   \n",
    "To get fast, memory efficient code we need to write **type stable** functions i.e. the types that are inferred of each variable never changes throughout the computation of the function.   \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[Multiple dispatch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_dispatch) can be thought of as a generalization of **object-oriented** (OO) programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a typical OO language like Python, an object type (class) *owns* certain *methods* (functions), and are typically called via\n",
    "```\n",
    "object.method(arg1, arg2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Depending on the type of `object`, the runtime system will *dispatch* to different `method` definitions.\n",

    "In Julia, the same call would be \"spelled\" differently:\n",
    "```\n",
    "method(object, arg1, arg2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Spelled this way, you should notice something odd about OO programming: why is the *first* argument so special?\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional OO programming corresponds to **single dispatch**: the runtime chooses `method` based on the type of the *first* argument only.   Julia implements **multiple dispatch**: the runtime chooses `method` based on the types of *all* the arguments."

    "\n",
    "(Notice that with this definition multiplication is a function, but the function can contain many methods - different ways of performing mulitplication - based on the types of the values. So a function can be described as a container for methods and this is a good description for how things work in Julia).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#####Not the same as overloading\n",
    "This may look a lot like function overloading in languages like C++.   The difference is that C++'s overloading is **static** (= *dispatch at compile-time*), whereas Julia's overloading is dynamic (= *dispatch at run-time*), like OO polymorphism."
